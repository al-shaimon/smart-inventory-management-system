* Include a **Demo Login button** (pre-filled credentials)

## **2\. Product & Category Setup**

### **Categories**

Users can create product categories:

### **Products**

Users can add products manually:  
Each product includes:

* Product Name  
* Category  
* Price

* Status:  
  * Active  
  * Out of Stock

## **3\. Order Management**

* Cancel orders  
* View orders (by date or status)

Each order includes:

## **4\. Stock Handling Rules**

When placing an order:

* If requested quantity exceeds stock:  
  * Show warning:  
    Only X items available in stock  
* Prevent order confirmation if stock is insufficient

If stock becomes **0**:

* Product status → Out of Stock

## **5\. Restock Queue (Low Stock Management)**

If product stock goes below threshold:

* Automatically add it to a **Restock Queue**

Queue rules:

Users can:

* Update stock manually (Restock)  
* Remove item from queue once restocked

## **6\. Conflict Detection**
